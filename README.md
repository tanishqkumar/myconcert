MyConCert is a web application built for physicians to help them spend less time on documentation, licensure, administration, and more time
doing research and treating patients. 

The application is built with Django and vanillaJS, and, once you log in, stores information about 
the journals you're subscribed to, medical association memberships you have, licenses your boards need, and displays all of this information in a beautiful dashboard
so you can keep on top of it at all times.

If you're a physician or developer of any flavour, please don't hesitate to get in touch to give feedback. This was a prototype built for a medtech 
startup.
